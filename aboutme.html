    <h3>Sports<br></h3>
    <p>I have been playing cricket since my primary school days and have always been fond of the game. I would always find myself going to cricket clubs and playing cricket in the streets.<br>
    Now I play with a local league cricket team, they host training/matches every Sunday.<br>
    Mainly I play the role of batsmen but consider myself an all-rounder and can sub out a bowler if needed.<br>
    On Saturdays I help run a youth club with 4 other members of staff. We run different activites, sports and camps for about 20 youths.</p>

    <h3>Outdoors<br></h3>
    <p>Occasionally I like to go hiking, bouldering or camping. Its a really good stress reliever and just gets you feeling better.<br>
    I've hiked/camped many areas in the Peak District and Snowdonia. I try to go atleast once a month with friends/family and have plans to hike Ben Nevis.

    <h3>Coding</h3>
    <p>I have had an interest in coding since highschool and practiced it on and off since then. I then saw the oppurtunity of the Code Nation course
        decided to see if I wanted to take it furhter. It has been really enjoyable so far and I am looking to further progress my skills.
